			<h1>About STAT 157</h1>
			<p>The old adage, let the data speak for itself, is often poor advice. Without context it can be difficult (even impossible) to glean insights from statistical graphs and tables. In this seminar, students gain experience in how to write about their data insights in a way that is both compelling and faithful to the data. We explore a variety of genres from technical articles to news stories and blog posts.  </p>


<p>In the seminar, students explore and analyse data and write about their findings.  We also read and review both exemplary published analyses and studentsâ€™ writing samples.  We use modern statistical tools to work in a reproducible environment so that others may follow our decision-making process and recreate our analyses.  By the end of the semester, students will have a portfolio of writing samples, including short pieces such as figure captions, Wikipedia entries, blog posts and news stories, and one technical paper.</p>
